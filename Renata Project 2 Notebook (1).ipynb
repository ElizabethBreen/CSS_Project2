    "The bias-variance tradeoff refers to a difficulty we face in building statistical models. When models are made to fit very closely to the data, often using a lot of different features or variables in the process, this introduces a lot of variance, or flexibility of fit. The upside of high dimensionality models is that they are very accurate to the training data and they have little bias.  But because of their flexibility, high dimensionality models risk measuring noise in the data and mistaking it for signal. This problem is referred to as overfitting. \n",
    "\n",
    "Models with lower dimensionality tend to be less accurate and more rigid, or biased. Low dimension models are likelier than high dimension models to underfit data. When choosing an appropriate machine learning model, we must strike a balance between a model that is too biased/rigid and a model that is too noisy/flexible. This is the bias-variance tradeoff.\n",
    "\n",
    "In traditional regression applications, scientists are often most interested in accurately and unbiasedly capturing any existing relationship in their data. But in machine learning, we are looking to predict future values of our outcome based on the body of data we’ve amassed. A model that hews too closely to the data on which it was trained is less likely to make accurate predictions. In machine learning, therefore, it’s vital that we strike the right balance between capturing variance and avoiding overfitting. \n"

   "source": [
    "Overfitting occurs when a model is so precisely matched to the training dataset that the model perceives variance in the sample as part of the underlying relationship between the independent and dependent variables. Overfitting is particularly problematic for machine learning applications, because a model that has been overfit (overfitted?) will try to predict future values of the dependent variable that match with the variance or noise in the training data. This means that overfit models will be less successful at prediction, and prediction is the whole point of machine learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can address overfitting through the use of regularizing techniques like Ridge regression and LASSO. These help us to avoid overfitting by shrinking or eliminating coefficients in our model with low values. This reduces the overall number of dimensions in the model, pushing the balance away from overfitting."

Would your answers change based on whether you want to take into account certain features such as the race, gender, or age composition in the county? How confident would you be deploying this sort of model in a real-world application, why or why not?"

    "A few caveats: Our predictions are made based on known (diagnosed) diabetes cases. However, in the United States today, many people are unable to access adequate medical care, including diabetes diagnosis and treatment. If diabetes is more common among populations with lesser access to medical care, this gives us greater reason to believe our measurement of diabetes prevalence is flawed.\n",

    "The data provided do not tell us the demographics (age, gender, race, education, etc.) of the people who have been diagnosed with diabetes. This means that rather than directly capturing that, for instance, it is Asian women over age 70 with the highest prevalence of diabetes, we could only see that counties with a higher proportion of Asian women over age 70 also have a higher proportion of diabetes cases. We recommend analysis with data at a more granular level before spending billions of taxpayer dollars.\n"
